Sleuthsayer creates a personalized roleplaying game on your Discord server. Most Discord roleplays create a single channel for each location in the game. Sleuthsayer turns that on its head by creating a channel for every _player character,_ which only that character's player can see. Sleuthsayer keeps track of who can see whom, and copies messages around as needed. This means that players don't know anything their character doesn't know, without any effort from the game host. This makes Sleuthsayer particularly effective for games based around exploration, intrigue, and deception - hence the name.

Sleuthsayer comes bundled with a scripting language called Sleuthscript for customization. There's no requirement to use it - Sleuthsayer comes with a sophisticated world model "out of the box", and the built-in actions give both players and game masters many options for interacting with it. Games that want to add their own actions, give custom behavior to special objects, or allow puzzles to run without the game master needing to be online might make use of it for any of those purposes. In fact, much of Sleuthsayer's behavior is implemented in Sleuthscript, using exactly the same customization options available to any game master! Just because the standard library says that a closed door always blocks vision doesn't mean you can't tweak that behavior in a game with X-ray vision goggles, for a totally random example.

Sleuthsayer is currently in _active development_. Work on core gameplay features should be wrapped in up in the coming months. If you want to get involved, either as a developer or just part of the community, join the discussion on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/J9T2sMuyHZ)! We're looking for not only people with technical skills, but also game masters and players who're interested in this project. You're the ones who'll actually use this thing, and we'd love your feedback!
